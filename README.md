# Crimewave: an API experiment
**A one-day experiment**

####Objectives

To experiment with APIs, AJAX, JavaScript and JQuery, I used Google Maps along with an unofficial police crime data API to build Crimewave.

Crimewave shows you all crimes in the past month within 1km of your chosen postcode, by category.
